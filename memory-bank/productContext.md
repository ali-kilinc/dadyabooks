Schools and parents need a simple, accessible way to track children's reading progress. Traditional paper-based reading logs are:
- Easily lost or damaged

- Not mobile-friendly for busy parents

### Target Users

1. **Parents (Veli)**
   - Want to track their child's reading progress
   - Need mobile-friendly access
   - Want to see what books their child has read and when
   - May have multiple children to track

2. **School Administrators**
   - Need to manage all students' reading records
   - Want to add new books to the system
   - Need to create parent accounts and link them to children
   - Want to track reading progress across the school

#### Secondary Users
- Teachers who may need to verify reading records
- School librarians managing book collections
