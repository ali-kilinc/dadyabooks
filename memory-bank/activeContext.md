# Active Context: Dadyabooks

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status
The Dadyabooks system is currently in a **functional state** with core features implemented and working. The system has been deployed and is ready for use by schools and parents for tracking children's reading progress.

### Recent Analysis
- **System Architecture**: Analyzed the complete codebase structure
- **Database Schema**: Identified core entities and relationships
- **API Endpoints**: Documented all REST API functionality
- **User Interface**: Reviewed responsive design implementation
- **Security Patterns**: Assessed authentication and authorization

## Current System State

### What's Working
1. **User Authentication**
   - Login system for both admin and parent users
   - Session-based authentication with role management
   - Secure password hashing and verification

2. **Child Management**
   - Admin can create parent accounts and link children
   - Parent users can only see their own children
   - Search functionality for finding children by name or school number

3. **Book Management**
   - Admin can add books to the catalog
   - Book search and suggestion system
   - Duplicate book prevention

4. **Reading Records**
   - Track which books children have read
   - Record reading dates
   - View reading history with search capabilities

5. **User Interface**
   - Responsive design using Bootstrap 5
   - Mobile-friendly interface
   - Real-time search with debouncing
   - Turkish language support throughout

### System Architecture
- **Frontend**: Single-page application with AJAX interactions
- **Backend**: PHP-based API with MySQL database
- **Authentication**: Session-based with role-based access control
- **Database**: Well-structured relational database with proper relationships

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Documentation Completion**: Finish memory bank documentation
2. **System Validation**: Verify all functionality works as expected
3. **User Testing**: Prepare for user acceptance testing
4. **Deployment Verification**: Ensure production environment is stable

### Potential Improvements
1. **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages and user feedback
2. **Performance**: Optimize database queries and frontend loading
3. **Security**: Review and strengthen security measures
4. **Features**: Consider additional functionality based on user feedback

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Database Design**: Chosen relational model with junction tables
- **Authentication**: Session-based rather than token-based
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap for rapid development and responsiveness
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent JSON responses

### Current Considerations
1. **Scalability**: How will the system handle growing numbers of users?
2. **Data Backup**: What backup strategy is in place?
3. **User Training**: How will users learn to use the system?
4. **Maintenance**: Who will maintain and update the system?

### Open Questions
1. **User Onboarding**: How will new parents be added to the system?
2. **Data Export**: Should there be functionality to export reading data?
3. **Reporting**: Are there any reporting requirements for administrators?
4. **Mobile App**: Would a native mobile app be beneficial?

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Shared Hosting Limitations**: Working within hosting constraints
- **No Automated Testing**: Manual testing required for all changes
- **Limited Monitoring**: Basic error logging only
- **No Version Control in Production**: Manual deployment process

### User Experience Challenges
- **Learning Curve**: Users need to understand the system interface
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensuring good mobile experience
- **Search Performance**: Optimizing search for large datasets
- **Data Entry**: Making book and reading record entry efficient

## Recent Changes

### Password Change Feature Implementation (Latest)
- **New File Created**: `/htdocs/password_change.php` - Complete password change page
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/htdocs/index.php` - Added password change link to main navigation
  - `/htdocs/admin/panel.php` - Added password change link to admin panel navigation
- **Features Added**:
  - Secure password change functionality with current password verification
  - Form validation (minimum 6 characters, password confirmation)
  - Turkish language interface consistent with system
  - Bootstrap 5 responsive design
  - Clear success/error messaging
  - Navigation integration with key icon (ðŸ”‘)

### Code Analysis Completed
- **File Structure**: Mapped all PHP files and their purposes
- **Database Schema**: Identified all tables and relationships
- **API Endpoints**: Documented all REST endpoints
- **Security Implementation**: Reviewed authentication and authorization
- **Frontend Implementation**: Analyzed JavaScript and CSS usage

### Documentation Created
